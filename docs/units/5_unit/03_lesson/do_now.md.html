# Do Now 5.03

1. Read through and participate in the following lessons in [EarSketch Editor]

      * 2.4.0 [for loop](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/#?curriculum=2-4-0)
      * 3.1.2 [Conditional Statements](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/#?curriculum=3-1-2)
      * 3.3.0 [Procedure - modulo](https://earsketch.gatech.edu/earsketch2/#?curriculum=3-3-0)

2. In your notebook, answer the following questions, based on the reading:
    * Describe how using a `for` loop can be useful in using EarSketch to create a new beat.
    * How can an `if` statement be used with the **modulo** operator in order to have a beat repeat *every other* measure?
