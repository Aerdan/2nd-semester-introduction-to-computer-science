# Do Now 4.04

## Part 1
1. Type and run the following code: 

    ```python
    # my_building is a representation of the apartments on each floor of my 3 story building
    my_building = [
    ['apt1a', 'apt1b', 'apt1c'],
    ['apt2a', 'apt2b', 'apt2c'],
    ['apt3a', 'apt3b', 'apt3c']
    ]
    print("first floor: " + str(my_building[0]))
    print("first floor, 3rd apartment: " + str(my_building[0][2]))
    ```

    Write down what was printed. How you would access the 2nd apartment of the 3rd floor (`apt3b`)?

2. Write a for loop that iterates over `my_building` and prints out each value (apartment number). Describe what happened.
