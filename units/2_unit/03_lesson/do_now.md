# Do Now 2.03

## Part 1

Open up the console. Type each line of the following code into the interactive editor: 

```
 >>> 5 < 3
 >>> 5 > 3
 >>> type(5 < 3)
 >>> type(5 > 3) 
 >>> my_favorite_animal = "cats"
 >>> user_favorite_animal = input("What is your favorite animal? ") 
 >>> my_favorite_animal == user_favorite_animal
 ```
### In your Notebook, answer the following:

1. What does `5 < 3` evaluate to?  
2. What is the type of `5 < 3`? What does that stand for (should be familiar from Snap!)?
3. What is the difference between `==` and `=` ?
4. What data type do you think `my_favorite_animal == user_favorite_animal` is? 

## Part 2
Open up the console. Type the following code into the interactive editor. 

```
 >>> months_with_driving_permit = 6
 >>> age = 16
 >>> can_get_license = months_with_driving_permit >= 6 and age >= 16
 >>> print(can_get_license) 
 
```

### In your Notebook, answer the following
1. What does `and` do here? What type do you think `can_get_license` is? 
2. Update the code to fit the new driving law: If you are over the age of 18 you don't need to have a permit. The other law still applies for people ages 16-18.
