## In your Notebook
### Answer the following questions.
1. How would you print out something 10 times?
2. What about 100? 
3. What about 1,000? 
4. Can you remember something from Snap! that might allow that? 

## What happens when you run this code?
### Open up the console. Type the following code using interactive mode. 

```python
while True: 
    print('a')
```

#### Try using other Boolean expressions instead of `True` (e.g. `4 > 5` and `9 != 2`), and explore what happens.
