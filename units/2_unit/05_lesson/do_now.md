# Do Now 2.05

## Part 1
Open up the console. Type the following code using interactive mode:



### Example 1

```
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 >>> b = a[0:2]
 >>> print(a)
 >>> print(b)
 
```


* In your notebook, What happens to a? What is b? What type is b? 

### Example 2


```
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 >>> a.remove('First Item')
 >>> print(a) 
```


* In your notebook, what does `remove` do? What would the length of this list be after `remove`? 

### Example 3
```
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456]
 >>> a.pop()
 >>> print(a) 
```


* In your notebook, what does `pop` do? What is the difference between `remove` and `pop`? 

### Example 4


```
 >>> a = [123, 'First Item', 456, 'Second Item']
 >>> b = a + ['Third Item']
 >>> print(a)
 >>> print(b)
 
```


* In your notebook, what happens to a? What is b? What type is b? 

### Example 5
 
 ```
=======
What happens to a? What is b? What type is b? 

### Example 5
```

 >>> a = []
 >>> print(len(a))
 >>> a.append('First Item')
 >>> print(a)
 
```


### In your Notebook

1. What was the length of `[]`?
2. What does `append` do? What would the length be after `append`?
